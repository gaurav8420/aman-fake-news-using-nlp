	Abstract-Intentionally deceptive content presented under the
guise of legitimate journalism is a worldwide information accuracy
and integrity problem that affects opinion forming, decision
making, and voting patterns. Most so-called 'fake news' is initially
distributed over social media conduits like Facebook and Twitter
and later finds its way onto mainstream media platforms such as
traditional television and radio news.</p>
<p>The fake news stories that
are initially seeded over social media platforms share key linguistic
characteristics such as making excessive use of unsubstantiated
hyperbole and non-attributed quoted content. In this paper, the
results of a fake news identification study that documents the
performance of a fake news classifier are presented. The Textblob,
Natural Language, and SciPy Toolkits were used to develop a novel
fake news detector that uses quoted attribution in a Bayesian
machine learning system as a key feature to estimate the likelihood
that a news article is fake.</p>
